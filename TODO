/*

1. if == -1 / perror / exit block can be wrapped in a function (if f_check -> return .. in main)

2. Just passing a splitted array of args would do the job
DONE

3. if outfile exists. rewrite! (this is shell mechanism)
DONE: fixed with O_TRUNC parameter in open function.

4. Check if everything is closed correctly and all dups are doing proper job

5. handle non-existent command

6. error status as in shell

7. IMPORTANT! we need a struct to perform all free and etc

8. Check for empty strings ?
